## Planning and assessment

Planning is the key to successful data migration. The *SharePoint Migration Assessment Tool* (SMAT) is a simple command-line tool that scans your SharePoint Server 2013 farm to help identify potential issues with the data that you plan to migrate to SharePoint in Microsoft 365. The results report points to articles to help fix any issues that are discovered. The tool runs in the background and doesn't affect your production environment.
