# Google Sheets permissions with Migration Manager Deep Scan

>[!Note]
>This feature is currently in **private preview** and not generally available.

You must grant Google Spreadsheet permissions before Migration Manager can run a **deep scan** on Google Sheets. 

To confirm you have granted this permission: 

1. Sign in with your Google admin credentials to the Google Marketplace.

2. Under Drive, verify that "See all your Google Sheets spreadsheets‚Äù permission shows **Granted**.

3. If it hasn't been granted, select **Grant access** at the top of the screen to grant permission.

4. Once permission has been granted, Migration Manger can run deep scans for Google Sheets spreadsheet files.
