# Archive Migration Manager tasks 

>[!Note]
> The ability to archive tasks will soon be retired. We recommend reviewing your archived migrations tasks and decide how you want to managed them. Archived tasks will not be deleted. 


Migration Manager lets you archive migration tasks, letting you save them to be run at a future date, and allowing you filter on only those in an active state.  Archived tasks can be reactivated at any time.

1. From the Migration tab, view your migration tasks.  Highlight the task you want to archive.
2. Select **Archive**.  The status column will change to "Archived".
