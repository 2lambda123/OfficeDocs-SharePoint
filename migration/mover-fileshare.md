# Authorizing the File share Connector

## Agent FAQ

The Mover file share agent is written using .NET Core, and therefore is available across many platforms.

>[!Important]
>As of September 26,2020, the minimum required Agent version is 1.3.5.0.

### Windows

The Windows Agent has two installers, one for the user-context and one for the service-context. The Windows Agent requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 or greater.

The differences between Windows installers are as follows:

#### User-context installer

- Installs and is run as the currently logged in Windows user.
- Automatically updates.
- Has access to local drives.
- Has access to mapped network drives.
- Is not available if the user logs out of Windows, or your remote desktop session expires.

#### Service-context installer

- Installs and is run as a Windows service.
- Must be manually updated.
- Has access only to local drives.
- Is always available, even if the current user logs out, or your remote desktop session expires.


#### Command line agents

The following Agents operate using a command line interface versus a user interface.

### macOS

- Navigate to the download location, and unzip the **Mover Agent**.
- Via the terminal, browse to the now unzipped `moveragent` folder, and run `./agent`.
- Copy the key from the line that reads `[1] INFO ocess.BifrostService: Bifrost service initialized with connector key: <key>`.
- Open our app, and in the **agent authorization** box, paste the key.

>[!Note]
>The minimum system requirements are macOS 10.12.

### Linux

- Navigate to the download location, and unzip the Agent.
- Via the terminal, browse to the now unzipped `moveragent` folder and run `./agent`.
- Copy the key from the line that reads `[1] INFO ocess.BifrostService: Bifrost service initialized with connector key: <key>`.
- Open our app in your browser, and paste the key into the agent authorization box.

### Windows command line installer (beta)

- Installs and is run as a command line executable.
- Must be manually updated.
- Built from the same code base as the Linux and macOS agents.

### How does the agent view users?

The Agent works with files and folders. All users who are separated into their own folders can easily be mapped to their new location in Office 365.

A good example would be a large listing of home drives. Each home drive for a user could be transfered to their respective new user in Office 365.

### Troubleshooting the agent

#### Checking the agent version

To check which version of the Server Client you have installed, on the menu bar, select the **Help** tab.

![faq agent](media/agent_version.png)

If you are using the Mac or Linux version of our Agent, to find out the version you are using, follow these instructions: **Show Agent Version**.

#### Accessing server agent log

To access the **Agent Log**, navigate to the folder directory that you installed the desktop agent. A .log file appears that you can review, and send to our support team if an error should occur.

>[!Note]
>The agent .log file default location is `Windows\System(32/64)\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Mover`

## Authorizing the desktop and server agent

To enable swift and painless copying of data from on-premises desktop and server hard drives, we provide a very tiny agent that any Windows operating system can install.

### Compatibility

Windows XP is not supported.
All other versions of Windows require the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6 for the Agent to function.

[Download and manually install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=48130)

### Security

The Agent may only initiate outbound communication with our own servers. All communication is via encrypted TLS and no service other than ours is allowed to work with the agent.

### Windows installation

For Mac and Linux, the Agent folder appears in your Downloads, and is run through **command line operations**.

1. Download the Agent .exe, and select **Run**.
