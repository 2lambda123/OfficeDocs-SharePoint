# Step 1 - Configure endpoints and Power Automate

Before you begin your workflow migration, configure the following endpoints.

## Configure endpoints

The following endpoints are required by workflow migration.

|Endpoint|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|https://service.powerapps.com ||
|https://api.bap.microsoft.com||
|https://gov.service.powerapps.us||
|https://gov.api.bap.microsoft.us||
|https://high.service.powerapps.us||
|https://high.api.bap.microsoft.us||
|https://service.apps.appsplatform.us||
|https://api.bap.appsplatform.us||



## Configure Power Automate 

If your tenant has never used Power Automate before, you must configure it before you begin migration. We recommend using Edge or Internet Explorer.

1.	Sign in to https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/ using an admin account.
2.	Select **Add database** to your default environment.
