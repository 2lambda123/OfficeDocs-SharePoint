# Overview



## How does it work?

Step 1: Configure endpoints and Power Automate
Step 2: Migrate workflows
Step 3: Activate workflows


## Get started

To get started:

Go to the [Migration Manager page of the new SharePoint admin center](https://aka.ms/ODSP-MM-BOX), and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.

Make sure that you have:

- **Access to the destination**: You must either be a global admin or OneDrive/SharePoint admin to the Microsoft 365 tenant where you want to migrate your content. 

- **Access to the source**: Have SharePoint Server account credentials that have read access to any workflow you plan to migrate.

- **Prerequisites installed:** Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.
