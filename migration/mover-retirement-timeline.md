# Mover.io retirement timeline

>[!Important]
>**Attention businesses or those with EDU plans**: We will soon be retiring the legacy [Mover](https://app.mover.io) tool's ability to migrate from [Google Drive](mm-google-overview.md), [Dropbox](mm-dropbox-overview.md), [Box](mm-box-overview.md), and [Egnyte](mm-egnyte-overview.md). Please use [Migration Manager](https://aka.ms/ODSP-MM) going forward.
>
>If you are currently in the middle of a Mover migration, you may continue using Mover until you finish your migration. However, you will not be able to create new connectors.  FastTrack led migrations are not impacted at this time.

>[**Individuals or students**: You may continue to use Mover. Learn how!](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/move-your-school-files-when-you-graduate-7dbda93c-71e6-483f-8914-ad445554cd31)


Mover's cloud migration scenarios have been fully made available in Migration Manager and we have set the timeline to retire Mover.
