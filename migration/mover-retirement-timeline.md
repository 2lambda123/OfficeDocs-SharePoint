# Mover Migration retirement timeline

>[!Important]
>**Attention businesses or those with EDU plans**: We will soon be retiring the legacy [Mover](https://app.mover.io) tool's ability to migrate from [Google Drive](mm-google-overview.md), [Dropbox](mm-dropbox-overview.md), [Box](mm-box-overview.md), and [Egnyte](mm-egnyte-overview.md). Please use [Migration Manager](https://aka.ms/ODSP-MM) going forward.

Mover's cloud migration scenarios have been fully made available in Migration MAnager and we have set the timeline to retire Mover. Unifying the migration experience within Migration Manager simplifies the tool decision for you and allows us to focus our development and support resources to help you meet your migration goals.


|Date|What|
|:-----|:-----|
|July 1, 2022|You will no longer be able to create Mover admin connectors to Box or Dropbox. Google and Egnyte connectors were disabled earlier this year.|
|TBA|Migrations between two Microsoft tenants.|
|TBA|Individual and end-user migrations.|


>[!Important]
>If you are currently in the midddle of a Mover migration, you may continue using Mover until you finish your migration. However, you will not be able to create new connectors.
