# Mover.io retirement timeline

>[!Note]
>Attention businesses or those with EDU plans: We have retired the legacy [Mover](https://app.mover.io) tool's ability for admin-led migrations from [Google Drive](mm-google-overview.md), [Dropbox](mm-dropbox-overview.md), [Box](mm-box-overview.md), and [Egnyte](mm-egnyte-overview.md). Please use [Migration Manager](https://aka.ms/ODSP-MM), located in the SharePoint admin center.
>
>*Ongoing migrations are not impacted by this change. However, you cannot create new connectors.* If you are currently in the middle of a Mover migration, you may continue using Mover until you finish your migration using your existing connectors.
>
>[**Individuals or students**: You may continue to use Mover, learn how!](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/move-your-school-files-when-you-graduate-7dbda93c-71e6-483f-8914-ad445554cd31)

>[!Important]
>**Attention FastTrack led customers:** Any FastTrack-led customer with multi-parent folders who has reached velocity migrations will NOT transition to Migration Manager.
>
>All other inflight content migration FastTrack-led customers will transition to Migration Manager. FastTrack completed their analysis of those customers who will remain on Mover due to a technical limitation of how multi-parent folders (a now deprecated Google feature) work.

## FAQs

**Question:**  Why are we retiring Mover.io?</br>
**Answer:**    Mover's cloud migration functionality is now fully integrated into Migration Manager, Microsoft'ts recommended tool for file migrations. This simplifies the experience for you and helps us support you more effectively.

**Question:** Why are we starting the retirement now?</br>
**Answer:**   Until now, we have been integrating the Moverâ€™s cloud migration functionality into Migration Manager. Migration Manager now offers the full functionality of Mover along with an improved experience within the Microsoft admin center. 


**Question:**  Will my current Mover migrations stop working?</br>
**Answer:**    No. Microsoft is retiring the ability to create **new** connectors. Existing migrations will continue to operate on Mover. However, we recommend transitioning your migrations to Migration Manager at your earliest convenience to ensure to get the latest migration tooling. 

**Question:**  I'm migrating using Mover. If my existing connector gets disconnected, can I still reauthorize it to continue?</br>
**Answer:**    Yes. You can reauthorize an existing connector assuming the existing connector was operational before the retirement. 

**Question:** Will individual or consumer migrations continue to work on Mover?</br>
**Answer:**   We'll continue to support individual, consumer, or student migrations from Mover for some time. Refer back to this page for updates on these migration scenarios. 

**Question:** Is tenant-to-tenant migration supported in Migration Manager?</br>
**Answer:**  No. Microsoft will be offering a solution that will be available sometime in 2023. This will be a premium feature distinct from legacy Mover. In the interim, we recommend using a third-party solution for your M365-to-M365 migration needs.
