# Scan and assess a SharePoint Server site with SPMT

SPMT 4.0 integrates SharePoint Server assessment directly in the tool.  You can now scan your source sites before migration, review the assessment results, and make any changes before you start your migration.

Same as the migration experience, you can add a new scan by following the wizard and manage all your scan tasks in the scan list page.

1. Select **Add a scan**.
2. Select a method.  In this example, select a single site.
