**Planning considerations:** 

- Even before a new employee’s first day on the job, they will need some information about NEO before the event itself. Consider a pre-onboarding SharePoint site that can help new employees gather the right documents and prepare for the NEO event as soon as they sign their offer letter. 

- Some new employees cannot attend the NEO event in-person. Consider if it’s better to pre-record an event that can be shown to people who cannot attend in-person or if you can live-stream the in-person event and new employees who are remote can join online. 

- Regardless of the NEO event attendance is in-person or remotely, the NEO audience will need access to the same resources on desktop and mobile devices. 


### Step 1: Start by determining your audience profile and size 

 

New employees will have diverse backgrounds, roles, and career experience. Some new employees will be able to attend an event in-person while other can only attend remotely. Some tools and resources will need to be accessible from a mobile device. The same resources will need to be available regardless of the new employee orientation method. 

The size of your onboarding group will determine the platforms and resources you use. Learn more about defining your audience profile and scoping audience size.

Define the desired outcome and priority content 

When each employee completes onboarding, what would the signifier of completion be? In many organizations, onboarding happens for more than one part of the business, consider offering an onboarding structure that allows the new employee to become familiar with the organization and the team they will be working with. Consider setting up modules that guide employees through onboarding and lets them know about their progress.  

Consider the tone and messaging for your onboarding process 

Make new employees feel welcome and excited to be joining your organization. Use PowerPoint to prepare a well-crafted message that lists out the various benefits and resources your new employees can take advantage of as members of your organization. Introduce them to the culture of your company by laying out company history, fun facts, and more.  

 

### Step 2: Map the ideal employee onboarding experience 

From inception to orientation to day one on the job, the new employee journey has a huge impact on the success of that employee. Ensure the new employee is provided the best tools to start out with by mapping out the new employee onboarding experience.

**Establish an onboarding timeline** 

What does a healthy and sustainable onboarding timeline look like at your organization? The answer to this question could depend on a few things:  

- The number of teams the employee will be working on 

- The amount of things the employee will be responsible for 

- The amount of partner relationships the employee will have 

- The amount of tools the employee will need to learn how to use 

The more items on this list, the longer the timeline should be. Establish a timeline that will give the new employee the space and opportunity to learn, establish relationships, and become acquainted with the tools and resources they will interact with daily.  

**Define which onboarding tasks need to be completed** 

Create deliverables that let you know that each employee has achieved full competency in a specific subject that is important to the job. This can be learning about the company itself, specific tools, organizational expectations, and more.  

**Collect, prioritize, and organize resources and content**  

When entering a new environment, understanding the order in which deliverables should be completed may be a blind spot for new employees. Help them prioritize onboarding deliverables by laying them out in a way that signals priority. This could be as simple as writing them out for them or integrating Microsoft Lists. Learn how to use Microsoft Lists to help onboard employees (bookmark link to Lists section in Tools). 

**Curate learning materials**  

Which learning materials are needed to help make the new employee successful? Curate learning modules for each employee that helps orient them on organizational needs, team needs, and the tools that they will be working with daily.

**Get feedback along the way** 

The goal of every onboarding process is to make sure each new employee feels fully equipped to be successful in their new job. Receiving honest feedback once employees are finished with the onboarding process is the best way to fill in the gaps and improve onboarding for incoming employees. Find out what worked and what could use improvement by creating simple and thoughtful surveys. Learn more about getting feedback using Microsoft Forms.

### Step 3: Review Microsoft 365 onboarding tools 

A great option is to use Teams meetings, live events, and chat functionality to welcome new employees and provide an engaging experience for those that can attend in-person as well as remote. Direct users to information and contacts on a SharePoint communications site. Consider using a NEO Yammer channel where new people can ask questions and get answers. You can even consider using SharePoint spaces for virtual training or facility tours. Then, bring it all together using Viva Connections which integrates SharePoint content into Microsoft Teams. 

- **Microsoft Teams meeting** - Meetings in Teams include audio, video, and screen sharing, and are great for communicating with groups of fewer than 300 individuals. Teams can be used for meetings that happen in-person, remotely, or a combination of the two. Additionally, the meeting can be recorded and shared with new employees who were unable to attend the meeting. 

- **SharePoint communication site** - Create a SharePoint communication site using the New employee onboarding site template. Use the site to direct new employees to relevant resources, contacts, and conversations in new employee Yammer communities.  

- **Yammer channel** – Create a Yammer channel just for new employees. Choose to create one NEO channel for the entire organization or region or create channels for each new group of new employees. Then, use the Yammer web part on the SharePoint NEO site to integrate the conversation with other resources and contacts.  

- **Viva Connections** – If your organization is using Viva Connections, you can integrate SharePoint sites into Microsoft Teams to bring new employee resources all into one place. Additionally, you can add new employee specific resources to the Viva Connections mobile experience and use audience targeting to make sure new employees see specific content. 

- **Viva Learning** - Use Viva Learning to curate learning modules for each employee that helps orient them on organizational needs, team needs, and the tools that they will be working with daily. 

- **SharePoint spaces**- Use SharePoint Spaces to create an immersive platform that allows new employees to take a virtual tour of the campus.

Give new employees the opportunity to connect with each other and build a supportive virtual community in Yammer. Yammer is a platform that connects leaders, communicators, and employees to build communities, share knowledge, and engage across the organization. Yammer allows you to set up a community specifically for new employees within the organizational platform.

Naturally, employees come across information at different times in their onboarding process. Creating a space where new employees can build a community for themselves gives them the opportunity to share information as they come across it. In this virtual space, new employees can share resources, share ideas, and get to know each other. It also helps them build internal bonds that can last over the course of their career.

### Ask for feedback using Microsoft Forms

(Insert preview screenshot)

The best way to improve the new employee onboarding experience is by asking for feedback. Understand what worked best and what could use improvement by asking for feedback after all deliverables have been completed by new employees. 

Use Microsoft forms to build short surveys that answer the questions that could inform the onboarding experience moving forward. 
Learn more about Microsoft forms. 

## Launch the new employee onboarding experience 

Use Outlook to invite all new employees to orientation. In this email, lay out all the resources starting with the Viva Connections homepage that contains links to the New Employee SharePoint site, the New Employee orientation live meeting event post, learning objectives and more. Be sure to include any necessary information and important direct contact. 

Gether insights from each platform along the way. Use these insights to inform managers, team leads, and other stakeholders. Look for insights such as live event attendance, audience reach, site traffic, and more. 

Use the feedback gathered from each onboarding cycle to inform the next onboarding cycle.
