- Identify your key sponsors and stakeholders and review key organizational priorities. Document a vision that will help provide direction and help you prioritize opportunities.
- Align key outcome goals with SharePoint capabilities to identify where you may need to invest in customization. Consider whether an “intranet in a box” solution might be appropriate for your organization.
- Think about governance. What processes will you need to create to provision, manage, and maintain sites and content? Do you have security, retention, or compliance goals that need to be considered?
- Think about branding and architecture—do you want all sites to share a common look and feel?
- Analyze possible opportunities to identify priorities.
