## Plan your leadership connection strategy
Start by making sure you understand your audience’s needs and preferences. Review [how to profile and scope your audience](/audience-profile). This scenario will have the most successful outcome when multiple communication methods are combined. Start with a SharePoint communication site and a Yammer channel that connects the organization with leadership. Then, plan and host a live event that is recorded and shared with others. Finally, bring all these communication elements together into an engaging mobile experience using Viva Connections.

- **SharePoint communication site** - Create a SharePoint communication site that houses all things leadership – everything from news and announcements to events, people profiles and networking opportunities. [Use the Leadership connection site template.](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-sharepoint-leadership-connection-site-template-a2996d9f-c08e-4de6-8696-a7de323c8add)
- **Yammer community** - [Use Yammer](https://support.microsoft.com/office/join-and-create-a-community-in-yammer-56aaf591-1fbc-4160-ba26-0c4723c23fd6) to instantly connect, ask questions, and share ideas with the leadership team. Then, [use the Yammer web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/join-and-create-a-community-in-yammer-56aaf591-1fbc-4160-ba26-0c4723c23fd6) to embed the conversation on the leadership connection SharePoint site. 
- **Yammer live events** - Use the [Yammer community for live events](/stream/live-event-m365#live-events-and-microsoft-365) and questions and answers. 
- **Viva Connections** - Bring the SharePoint site and Yammer conversation into one place where users can catch up and connect with leaders in the Microsoft Teams mobile app. [Learn more about Viva Connections](/guide-to-setting-up-viva-connections). 


### Planning considerations:

- Multiple communication solutions can be combined to provide opportunities across the organization to connect with leadership regardless of worksite location or time zone.
- Create opportunities outside of a live event to allow everyone within the organization to connect, network, and learn from leadership teams.
- Develop communication channels that collect feedback and questions for the leadership team, and save responses for the next live event.
- Create a practice of recording live events that can be shared and viewed later.
- Build durable communication methods that do not require organized events to generate content.
- Identify other opportunities across the organization to spread awareness about the leadership connection initiative such as new. employee orientation, regular communications to networking groups, and promotion in employee resource groups.


## Build your communication strategy
Start by creating or leveraging an existing SharePoint communication site. Then connect a new or existing Yammer community to the SharePoint site using the Yammer conversations web part. Then, plan and host live events, share the recordings on the leadership site, and keep the conversation going in Yammer channels. 

### Step 1: Create a SharePoint leadership site
SharePoint communication sites are a great tool to create a landing place to share leadership news, initiatives, and opportunities to network and connect. This is an ideal opportunity to use the [Yammer web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-a-yammer-web-part-in-sharepoint-online-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da) on the home page to connect to an existing Yammer community that connects leadership team members with the rest of the organization. Use the [Events web part](https://support.microsoft.com/\office/use-the-events-web-part-5fe4da93-5fa9-4695-b1ee-b0ae4c981909) to post and [target leadership events to specific audiences](https://support.microsoft.com/office/target-navigation-news-and-files-to-specific-audiences-33d84cb6-14ed-4e53-a426-74c38ea32293).

#### Get started creating your SharePoint leadership site
There are several resources that can help you quickly create a leadership site:
-	Use a SharePoint site template provided by Microsoft. [Apply the Leadership connection template](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-sharepoint-leadership-connection-site-template-a2996d9f-c08e-4de6-8696-a7de323c8add), then customize the site to for the needs of your organization.
-	Create your own leadership site following [step-by-step instructions in this guided walkthrough](https://support.microsoft.com/office/guided-walkthrough-creating-a-leadership-site-for-your-organization-e4a984db-d277-45ab-b18e-fa117b25bb4d).  
-	Use the Leadership connection template in the SharePoint look book. The [SharePoint look book Leadership connection template](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/details/c19f437b-35ca-42f2-b27a-1caa49ad8bde) requires the use of [SharePoint PowerShell](powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online?view=sharepoint-ps) and administrative credentials. 

#### Publish news from the leadership site
Once your leadership site has been created and shared with the right audiences, you can [publish news from this site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-share-news-on-your-sharepoint-sites-495f8f1a-3bef-4045-b33a-55e5abe7aed7). Then, use the [News web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-news-web-part-on-a-sharepoint-page-c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165) on the home page to display leadership news and [target leadership news to specific audiences](https://support.microsoft.com/office/target-navigation-news-and-files-to-specific-audiences-33d84cb6-14ed-4e53-a426-74c38ea32293). Other sites across your organization can customize the settings in the News web part to pull news from an organizational news site. Consider cross promoting leadership news on the home site, on a new employee onboarding site, and where other leadership-oriented news can be found.

#### Monitor usage analytics for your SharePoint site
As a SharePoint site owner, you can view information about how users interact with your site. For example, you can view the number of people who have visited the site, how many times people have visited the site, and a list of files that have received the most views. Learn more about how to [access usage data for your leadership site](https://support.microsoft.com/office/view-usage-data-for-your-sharepoint-site-2fa8ddc2-c4b3-4268-8d26-a772dc55779e).
