- **Business owners and site owners**—The various stakeholders who will be responsible for creating and maintaining portions of the intranet.
- **Content authors** — The people creating and managing content on sites and pages.

**What you'll learn**:

Intranets are a constant work in progress and are never really considered done.

Celebrate your initial launch, plan to monitor and maintain your intranet and its content over time as the organization changes and business goals evolve.

## How to think about an intelligent vs traditional intranet design

The new, modern experience in SharePoint is designed to be compelling, flexible, and more performant. The [modern experience](trad-vs-modern-intranet.md) makes it easier for anyone to create beautiful, dynamic sites and pages that are accessible and mobile-ready. Modern SharePoint supports intelligent workplaces — those that apply the collective knowledge of current users, share and collaborate easily, and engage audiences with targeted content and news. 


| Traditional intranet           | Intelligent intranet                |
| :----------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Communication primarily through email  | Communication primarily through [SharePoint sites](https://support.office.com/article/What-is-a-SharePoint-communication-site-94A33429-E580-45C3-A090-5512A8070732) and [community portals](https://support.office.com/article/video-what-is-yammer-47526868-b136-40cc-a80d-c870eadd9ba5)|

- Have an executive sponsor and identify intranet champions.
- Establish KPIs that are regularly communicated from the project's start to finish.
- Design for simplicity and longevity.
- Involve your business owners and users to get feedback during all stages of the design process.
- Establish a governance plan that defines roles and responsibilities, guidelines, and best practices, compliance and retention, provisioning sites, and expectations for content management.
- Audit existing content to ensure quality and relevancy before migrating to a new intranet.
- Align your intranet with your organization brand and culture.
