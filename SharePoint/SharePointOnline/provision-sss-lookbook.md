# Provision the SharePoint Success Site from the look book

Once you confirm the person provisioning *and* the tenant being provisioned meet the following [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/provision-sss#meet-the-prerequisites), you are ready to provision:

- You are using *at minimum* SharePoint administrator credentials
- Your tenant has the App Catalog installed
- You are an Administrator of the App Catalog
- Your tenant has version 4.0 or higher of the M365 learning pathways provisioned


## Start provisioning from the look book
If you already have M365 learning Pathways version 4.0 *or higher* provisioned to your tenant, you can provision the SharePoint Success Site from the look book. If you aren't sure what version of M365 learning pathways is installed in your tenant, review the [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/provision-sss#meet-the-prerequisites) and then provision the SharePoint Success Site. 

1. Go to the [look book](https://provisioning-test.sharepointpnp.com/details/0b860749-56a0-4c4c-992c-536d56d9accf) and select **Add to your tenant**.

12. Next, follow the steps below to add site owners to the M365 learning pathways administration page and the SharePoint Success Site to grant access to others for site and content [customizations](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/customize-sss). 


## Add Site owners 

Assign a few Site owners to grant administrative privileges to customize the site and training content. In order to hide, show, or enable playlists, users will need Site owner permissions to the M365 learning pathways site. In order to edit the look, navigation, and site content, users will need Site owner permissions to the SharePoint Success Site.

**Add Site owners to both sites:**

1. From the site select **Settings**, then select **Site permissions**.
2. Select **Advanced Permission Settings**.
3. Select **Site owners**.
4. Select **New > Add users to this group**, and then add the people you want to be **Site owners**.
5. Include a link to Explore the site in the sharing message, and then select **Share**.
