# Get answers to common questions about the Viva Connections Feed 

**Question:** What do I expect to see on the Feed?
<br>

**Answer:** The Feed will give content publishers a reliable means of distributing important news and information that their users need within their organizations.  In addition, users will also see engaging content from sites they are a member of/follow and communities they follow. The list of content that users will see in their feed for the Viva Connections current release is listed in the question “Where is content sourced for the Feed?”. As fresher content is added to your feed, older content will be pushed down the feed. 

However, we don’t rely on a pure chronological ranking. We will look at several factors to determine the content ranking and users will only be able to view content that they have permission to view. Refer to the question “How is the feed personalized and ranked?" for more information.



**Question:** Where is content sourced for the Feed?
<br>

**Answer:** In the current release of Viva Connections, Feed content will come from:
1. News published via SharePoint sites:
- SharePoint News from [organizational news sites](organization-news-site.md) 
- SharePoint News from sites you follow/sites you are a member of
- Boosted SharePoint News from Org News Sites
- User Targeted News from Org News site or sites you follow
2. Posts published in Yammer communities:
- Yammer All Company Featured Posts
- Yammer All Company Announcements 
- Yammer All Company Posts
- Yammer Followed Community Featured Posts
- Yammer Followed Community Announcements
- Yammer Followed Community Posts
3. [Stream videos](/stream/streamnew/new-stream) built on SharePoint or OneDrive 


Not all of the content will be given equal weight in the ranking, refer to the question “How is the feed personalized and ranked?" for more information.




**Question:** How often is Feed content refreshed? 
<br>

**Answer:** For mobile, the feed refreshes on each boot of the application. Users can also manually refresh the feed through the pull-down action. On the web, the feed automatically refreshes each time the web page is refreshed.



**Question:** When can we expect to see a post in the feed after creating it?
<br>

**Answer:** Posts will typically take up to a maximum of 1 hour to appear on a user’s feed.  Content from newly created Home sites is sometimes delayed for 7 days after the site is initially created.  After that initial 7 day period has passed, it will take the typical 1 hour to appear.




**Question:** How is the feed personalized and ranked?
<br>

**Answer:** We’re experimenting and rapidly iterating on the logic used:

- **Chronology** - Content is sorted into 3 buckets.
- **Promotion** - Boost & Featured is surfaced highly in each bucket.
- **Source Priority** - “Top Down” messaging is ranked slightly higher than organic content from people around you.
- **Engagement** - Ensure dynamic mix of content types within each bucket.
