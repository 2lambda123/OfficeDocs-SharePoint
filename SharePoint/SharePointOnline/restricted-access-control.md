# Restricted Site Access for SharePoint sites

Restricted Site Access lets you allow only users in specified Microsoft 365 group to access a SharePoint site. Even if other users outside of the Microsoft 365 group have received sharing links for the site or its content, they wonâ€™t have access to the content unless they are members of the Microsoft 365 group connected to the site

Changing user permissions from a group perspective reduces the risk of oversharing and protects sites containing sensitive information.

Enabling the Restricted Access Control feature enforces a label policy and provides newly-added flags, and grants access to members of the Microsoft 365 group associated with the site.

The Restricted Access Control policy can be enabled at the tenant-level or a site-level with PowerShell depending on your needs.

## How to enable policy on the tenant using PowerShell

Run the following command:

```PowerShell
    Set-SPOTenant -EnableRestrictedAccessControl $true
```

## How to enable policy at the site level using PowerShell

Run the following command:

```PowerShell
    Set-SPOSite -Identity <> -RestrictedAccessControl $true
```
