## Sharing options

You can specify sharing options such as the default sharing type for users, with whom they can share, and how long sharing links remain active.

These are the key decisions around sharing for OneDrive:

- **Do you want to allow external sharing?** If you enable external sharing for OneDrive, your users will be able to share files and folders with people outside your organization.

- **If you allow external sharing, do you want to allow unauthenticated users?** If you enable sharing with **Anyone**, users can create sharable links that don't require sign-in.

- **What do you want the default sharing link to be?** Users can choose which type of link to send (Anyone, People in your organization, or Specific people), but you can choose the default option that is presented to users.

- **Do you want to restrict external sharing by domain?** You can restrict external sharing to specific domains or prevent sharing with specific domains.

Note that the OneDrive sharing settings are a subset of the SharePoint sharing settings. If you want to allow external sharing in OneDrive, it must be enabled for SharePoint. For more info, see [File collaboration in SharePoint with Microsoft 365](/sharepoint/deploy-file-collaboration).


- Specify settings for sharing links and control external sharing: [Manage sharing](manage-sharing.md)

- **Sharing** - Use the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185222" target="_blank">Sharing page in the SharePoint admin center</a> to configure your sharing options based on the decisions you made earlier in this guide. To learn more, see [Manage sharing settings](/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off).
