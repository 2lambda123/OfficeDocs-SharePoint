# Sharing and collaboration options in SharePoint and OneDrive



- Site creation
- File and folder sharing
- External sharing




## Site creation



[Manage who can create Microsoft 365 Groups](/microsoft-365/solutions/manage-creation-of-groups)

[Manage site creation in SharePoint](/sharepoint/manage-site-creation)


## External sharing

OneDrive vs. SharePoint settings

Note that the OneDrive sharing settings are a subset of the SharePoint sharing settings. If you want to allow external sharing in OneDrive, it must be enabled for SharePoint. For more info, see [File collaboration in SharePoint with Microsoft 365](/sharepoint/deploy-file-collaboration).


- Specify settings for sharing links and control external sharing: [Manage sharing](manage-sharing.md)

- **Sharing** - Use the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185222" target="_blank">Sharing page in the SharePoint admin center</a> to configure your sharing options based on the decisions you made earlier in this guide. To learn more, see [Manage sharing settings](/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off).


- **Do you want to allow external sharing?** If you enable external sharing for OneDrive, your users will be able to share files and folders with people outside your organization.

- **If you allow external sharing, do you want to allow unauthenticated users?** If you enable sharing with **Anyone**, users can create sharable links that don't require sign-in.

- **Do you want to restrict external sharing by domain?** You can restrict external sharing to specific domains or prevent sharing with specific domains.

Guest access to a site or OneDrive will expire automatically after this many days

If your administrator has set an expiration time for guest access, each guest that you invite to the site or with whom you share individual files and folders will be given access for a certain number of days. For more information visit, Manage guest expiration for a site

People who use a verification code must reauthenticate after this many days

If people who use a verification code have selected to "stay signed in" in the browser, they must prove they can still access the account they used to redeem the sharing invitation.

## File and folder sharing


- **What do you want the default sharing link to be?** Users can choose which type of link to send (Anyone, People in your organization, or Specific people), but you can choose the default option that is presented to users.
