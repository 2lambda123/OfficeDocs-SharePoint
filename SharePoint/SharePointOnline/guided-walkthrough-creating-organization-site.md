## Manage sections and web parts

Sections make up your page, and are where you place one or more web parts. While editing the page, each section will show controls to edit the layout, move, or delete the sections.

If your page is not already in edit mode, select **Edit** on the top right of the page.

The + symbol before or after a section will add a section using one of several layouts.

## Keep everyone up to date

The Enterprise Landing page uses two different [News web parts](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-news-web-part-on-a-sharepoint-page-c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165). One uses the **Carousel** layout, and the other uses the **Top story** layout. In the example [at the beginning of the article](#example-enterprise-landing-site), these layouts are both in the first column of two-column [sections](https://support.microsoft.com/office/guided-walkthrough-creating-an-organization-site-9c1842c3-543e-4891-85d3-0eaf680e242d?storagetype=live#bkmk_sectionswebparts) on the page. In the second column is an [Events web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-events-web-part-5fe4da93-5fa9-4695-b1ee-b0ae4c981909) that you can use to display upcoming events and activities. The second example photo below includes the [Countdown timer web part](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-the-countdown-timer-web-part-a13ffef8-0bf1-409e-be23-98af1d1736e7) to generate excitement for things like an upcoming event, activity, or launch.
