	Current state of business and mapping to new service
	User journey / core use cases (test cases for pilot rollout)

What additional capabilities are you trying to enable beyond what you've been using?


## Business requirements gathering


Involve legal and compliance from the beginning to map out the user journey.

Drive agreement across stakeholders. Market the services internally.

Evaluate customization needs and consider resources needed and maintenance overhead.

		• What compliance features should be in place at rollout?
	
	• Do you have paper records to import?
Do you have client data to store that has compliance or perms requirements?


## Keys to successful user adoption

User adoption is important to the overall success of any new application. Ideally, to feel that you have maximized your investment in Microsoft 365 and OneDrive, you need to maximize user engagement with them. To do that, start by focusing on three critical success factors:

- **Stakeholders.** Securing the participation and buy-in of key people within your organization is critical to successful user adoption. This support can come from business-focused leaders, IT leadership, or anyone else who has a vested interest in seeing OneDrive and Microsoft 365 succeed in the organization. It is important to have both executive or business leader support and product champions to help carry the knowledge to their peers. Whether you're formally delegating the product champion role or allowing it to grow organically, champions are mission critical to user adoption. In fact, a SharePoint user study in 2013 showed that people prefer to learn from a coworker than from an IT employee. For more info about how to identify key stakeholders for your OneDrive and Microsoft 365 implementation, see the [Identify key stakeholders guide](https://aka.ms/execsponsor). For more info about building a sustainable champion community, see [Build a champion program](https://aka.ms/office365champions).

- **Scenarios.** When planning to implement OneDrive and Microsoft 365, identify and define your business scenarios and how those scenarios align with the benefits of implementing OneDrive and Microsoft 365. Work with your key stakeholders to identify the goals of the business scenarios, and then match those goals against usage scenarios. For example, a business goal may be to maximize user productivity; a key usage scenario enabling that goal would be using OneDrive to access files from mobile devices, PCs, and Macs. For help with this process, see the [Productivity Library](https://support.office.com/article/d8ab82a5-5f02-4439-816b-4a5d35133e48).

- **Awareness and training.** Creating awareness through awareness campaigns such as announcements, launch events, newsletters, town hall meetings, contests, and giveaways is a critical path to maximizing adoption. In addition, providing users with knowledge through classroom-style sessions and self-help guides helps them feel empowered to use OneDrive and Office 365.

Many resources are available from Microsoft to help you drive user adoption within your environment. For more info about a recommended Microsoft 365 user adoption strategy, see the [Microsoft 365 End User Adoption Guide](https://fto365dev.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/DocResources/en-us/Microsoft%20365%20User%20Adoption%20Guide.pdf). For more info about driving user engagement, see [Success Factors for Office 365 End User Engagement](https://fto365dev.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/DocResources/en-us/Resources/Office365_AdoptionBrochure_v2.0_Screen.pdf). You can also contribute to or comment on adoption-related ideas in the [Driving Adoption Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Driving-Adoption/ct-p/DrivingAdoption).
