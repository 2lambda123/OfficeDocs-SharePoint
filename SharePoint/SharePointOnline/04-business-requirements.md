# 

	Current state of business and mapping to new service
	User journey / core use cases (test cases for pilot rollout)

What additional capabilities are you trying to enable beyond what you've been using?


## Business requirements gathering


Involve legal and compliance from the beginning to map out the user journey.

Drive agreement across stakeholders. Market the services internally.

Evaluate customization needs and consider resources needed and maintenance overhead.

		• What compliance features should be in place at rollout?
	
	• Do you have paper records to import?
Do you have client data to store that has compliance or perms requirements?
