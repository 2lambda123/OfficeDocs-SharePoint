# Set up a home site for your organization
  
A home site is a SharePoint [communication site](https://support.office.com/article/94A33429-E580-45C3-A090-5512A8070732) that you create and set as the top landing page for all users in your intranet. It brings together news, events, embedded video and conversations, and other resources to deliver an engaging experience that reflects your organization's voice, priorities, and brand. 

## Home site capabilities

When you set a site as your home site:

- It's easily accessible from the SharePoint mobile app for Android and iOS. All users that have access to the home site will see a home button on the Find tab of the mobile app. Being communication sites, home sites are designed to be mobile friendly from the start.

- Search for the site is scoped to all sites within the organization. Having a great search experience is critical for the success of the home site. [Learn more about Microsoft Search](/microsoftsearch/overview-microsoft-search)

- The site is automatically set up as an [organization news site](organization-news-site.md). (Although you can have only one home site, you can have multiple organization news sites.)
- The site is enabled for [configuring the global navigation in the SharePoint app bar](sharepoint-app-bar.md#get-started-customizing-the-global-navigation-tab).

- Having a home site enables you to use [Viva Connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/SharePoint/viva-connections).

> [!NOTE]
> Integration between the home site and [SharePoint start page](https://support.office.com/article/6b85097a-87e0-4611-a29a-dfd49b1a1220) (where the branding, theming, header, navigation, and footer elements from the home site are applied to the start page and users can easily navigate between the pages) is not available at this time. Please watch for updates in the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=SharePoint).

## Plan and create your home site

To set a site as your organization's home site, you first need to create and customize the site you want to use.

1. When you design your organization's top landing page, consider the goals from the perspective of your IT department, your organization's communications team, and end users of the experience.
2. Create a communication site to use for the home site, and customize it using built-in features as much as possible:
