# Custom list templates

    > If you installed a previous version of the SharePoint Online Management Shell, go to Add or remove programs and uninstall "SharePoint Online Management Shell." 

2. Connect to SharePoint as a [global admin or SharePoint admin](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) in Microsoft 365. To learn how, see [Getting started with SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).

    ```PowerShell
    Set-SPOTenant -DisablePersonalListCreationÂ $true
    ```
