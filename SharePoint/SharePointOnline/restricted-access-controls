# Safeguard access to SharePoint sites based on Microsoft 365 Group Membership

Protect SharePoint site content with Restricted Access Control (RAC).

This new SharePoint Advanced Management (SAM) feature enables a label policy that restricts user access to SharePoint sites based on Microsoft 365 group membership.

Modifying user permissions from a Microsoft 365 group perspective reduces the risk of oversharing and safeguards sites containing sensitive information.

The Restricted Access Control policy is enabled on a tenant level or a site level depending on your needs. 

How to get RAC and SAM: Need to find out how users can get this premium feature. Need to ask about SAM license check.

## How to enable policy on the tenant using PowerShell

 ```PowerShell
   Set-SPOTenant â€“EnableRestrictedAccessControl $true
    ```
```

## How to enable policy at the site level PowerShell

 ```PowerShell
   Set-SPOSite Identity <> -RestrictedAccessControl $true
    ```
```
