# Safeguard access to SharePoint sites based on Microsoft 365 Group Membership

Protect SharePoint site content with Restricted Access Control (RAC).

Restricted Access Control is a new feature from the SharePoint Advanced Management (SAM) add-on that provides premium features to assist IT administrators in overseeing site management policies, data access governance, and collaboration insights.

Changing user permissions from a group perspective reduces the risk of oversharing and safeguards sites containing sensitive information.

The Restricted Access Control policy can be enabled on a tenant level or a site level depending on your needs using PowerShell.

Enabling the Restricted Access Control feature enforces a label policy and provides newly-added flags to let users access to only SharePoint sites based on Microsoft 365 group membership.

## How to enable policy on the tenant using PowerShell

Run the following command:

```PowerShell
    Set-SPOTenant -EnableRestrictedAccessControl $true
```

## How to enable policy at the site level PowerShell

Run the following command:

```PowerShell
    Set-SPOSite -Identity <> -RestrictedAccessControl $true
```
