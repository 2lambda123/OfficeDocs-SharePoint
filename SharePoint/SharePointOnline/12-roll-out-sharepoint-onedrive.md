## Pilot rollout of SharePoint and OneDrive

Rollouts often regional or department-based.

Rollouts start small and then increase in speed and scope and learnings processed.

### Best practices

Users should be able to test core use cases

Rollouts include a pilot in a non-business-critical area, maybe with tech-savvy users.

Pilot group should not be client-facing

### Who to include in the pilot


Do you want
Group of technical people
Broad spectrum of different users across departments


Create a group of knowledgeable stakeholders across departments and disciplines to specifically test the core use cases

### Rolling out the pilot

collect reports from pilot users - have a process for this

Use pilot program to shake out bugs and ramp up support.
