# Roll out SharePoint and OneDrive

Be sure you've reviewed these SharePoint and OneDrive deployment resources before you start your rollout.

- [Plan for SharePoint and OneDrive in Microsoft 365](plan-for-sharepoint-onedrive.md)
- [Identify business requirements for SharePoint and OneDrive](business-requirements.md)
- [Create a compliant SharePoint and OneDrive environment](compliant-environment.md)
- [Plan sharing and collaboration options in SharePoint and OneDrive](collaboration-options.md)
- [Migration planning for SharePoint and OneDrive rollout](plan-rollout-migration.md)
- [Training and change management for rolling out SharePoint and OneDrive](training-change-management.md)

Also, make sure your [migration plans](rollout-migration.md) plans are in place as you roll out.

We highly recommend rolling SharePoint and OneDrive out to a pilot group before rolling them out to your entire organization. A pilot program can help you test your business processes and determine if there's further change management or training needed to help your users succeed with SharePoint and OneDrive.

## Pilot rollout of SharePoint and OneDrive



Rollouts often regional or department-based.

Rollouts start small and then increase in speed and scope and learnings processed.

Use pilot program to shake out bugs and ramp up support.

Create success criteria. When will you know it's time to do a broad rollout?

### Best practices

Consider the following best practices as you plan your pilot program.

Pilot users should be able to test core use cases. SharePoint and OneDrive enable a wide variety of capabilities. Some may be entirely new to your organization. Consider choosing pilot users who can validate your organization's core SharePoint and OneDrive use cases.

Avoid piloting with users who need to interact with your customers regularly. Initial pilot users will be using new processes for the first time. To give your customers the best service, you may want to leave customer-facing people out of the initial pilot.

Likewise, you may want to pilot in an area or department of the organization that is not business-critical.

### Who to include in the pilot

We recommend that you create a group of knowledgeable stakeholders across departments and disciplines to specifically test the core use cases you've identified for SharePoint and OneDrive.

Depending on how technical your users are, you may want to do the initial pilot with highly technical users, such as people in your IT department. Once these users are successfully using SharePoint and OneDrive, consider extending the pilot to a wider variety of users who can test all the needed use cases in the regular flow of their work.

### Rolling out the pilot

Once you have [trained the users](training-change-management.md) in your pilot group, you can give them access to SharePoint and OneDrive. This may include migrating content for them (or allowing them to do so themselves) or setting up [SharePoint Server hybrid](hybrid.md).

Be sure there's a process to collect information from pilot users and allow them to report issues. If your help desk or support personnel are involved in the pilot process, they may be able to manage this with existing processes.

Monitor the pilot as it proceeds. When the people involved are able to easily accomplish the expected tasks, consider rolling the pilot out to a larger group.

Once the people in your pilot are able to validate the expected use cases and the number of issues reported is low, consider scheduling the remaining rollout for the rest of the organization.

## Rolling out SharePoint and OneDrive broadly

Once your pilot program has concluded successfully, you can roll SharePoint and OneDrive out to the rest of your organization.
