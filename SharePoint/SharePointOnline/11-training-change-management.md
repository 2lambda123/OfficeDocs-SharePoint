As part of your change management plan, review how your users do core tasks such as:
- Where to save personal work files
- Where to save shared files
- How to share files with others in the organization
- How to share files with people outside the organization
- How to create a site or other location for collaboration with others

Your users will need to learn how to do these tasks in SharePoint and OneDrive. The resources below can help users learn how to do these and other tasks. If you have specific business processes around these tasks, you may need to create separate documentation for your users to incorporate that.
