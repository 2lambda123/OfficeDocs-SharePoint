# Provision the SharePoint Success Site 

Start the SharePoint Success Site provisioning process by understanding the prerequisites. Then, you can provision the site from the look book or Microsoft 365 learning pathways administration page. 
Global administrator or SharePoint admin credentials are required to start the provisioning process for the SharePoint Success Site. Before getting started, make sure you've met the prerequisites for provisioning. 


## Meet the prerequisites

Before provisioning the SharePoint Success Site, meet the prerequisites for both the **person** provisioning and the **tenant.** Your tenant's configuration will determine what path you need to take to install the SharePoint Success Site. Start by reviewing the SharePoint Success Site prerequisites below to prepare your tenant. 

| Tenant admin requirements | +  | Tenant requirements |  = | Ready to provision         |
| :----------------: | :----------------: |:-------------:|:----------------: | :----------------: |



Use this decision tree to determine your tenant’s path to meeting prerequisites:

Ready to get started provisioning? Review the [provisioning instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/provision-sss#provision-the-sharepoint-success-site-1). 

<br>

#### The person doing the provisioning must meet the following pre-requisites:

The **person** doing the provisioning must be a Global admin or a SharePoint admin where the SharePoint Success Site will be provisioned *and must also be* an Administrator of the tenant’s App Catalog.


| SharePoint admin role | +  | Admin of the App Catalog | = | Tenant admin requirements met         |
| :----------------: | :----------------: |:-------------:|:----------------: | :----------------: |

**Are you a SharePoint administrator?**
- **Yes** -  Next, confirm your tenant has already enabled the App Catalog.
- **No** -  Partner with your M365 Global administrator or SharePoint admin to get the site provisioned or to [change your security permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?WT.mc_id=365AdminCSH&view=o365-worldwide).
<br>
<br>
If you are unsure, you can confirm your role by logging into office.com, you’ll see an Admin center app icon next to your M365 apps if you have SharePoint administrator credentials.

**Are you an Administrator of the App Catalog?**
- **Yes** - Next, confirm your tenant has M365 learning Pathways provisioned.
- **No** - Next, ask your Global admin or SharePoint admin to add you as an [App Catalog administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/addappadmin).

	
#### The tenant must meet the following provisioning pre-requisites:

The **tenant** where the site will be provisioned must have the [App Catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-app-catalog) installed *and* have the latest version of [M365 learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/#:~:text=Microsoft%20365%20learning%20pathways%20is%20a%20customizable%2C%20on-demand,adoption%20of%20Microsoft%20365%20services%20in%20your%20organization.). installed. Your tenant must have **version 4.0 or higher** of M365 learning pathways.

| App Catalog installed | +  |M365 learning pathways 4.0 installed | = | Tenant requirements met         |
| :----------------: | :----------------: |:-------------:|:----------------: | :----------------: |


**Does your tenant have the App Catalog installed?**
- **Yes** - Next, confirm you are an administrator of the App Catalog.
- **No** - Next, [enable the App Catalog](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=where+to+find+the+app+catogue+in+sharepoint&docid=608008189208497248&mid=99CF7FB554B328AC189899CF7FB554B328AC1898&view=detail&FORM=VIRE) (this will take about 30 minutes).
<br>
<br>
If you are unsure, navigate to the SharePoint admin center, then select **Sites > Active sites** and you will see the **App Catalog**:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you need to create a App Catalog, wait at least 30 minutes after creating before provisioning M365 learning pathways and the SharePoint Success Site. 
 
**Does your tenant have M365 learning pathways provisioned?**
- **Yes** - Next, confirm you are using version 4.0 or higher.
- **No** - [Provision M365 learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/) for the first time.
<br>
<br>
If you are unsure, navigate to the SharePoint admin center, then select **Sites > Active sites** and you will see **Microsoft 365 learning pathways**.
 
**Is your tenant's version of learning pathways version 4.0 or higher?**
- **Yes** - You are ready to provision the SharePoint Success Site.
- **No** - Update to version 4.0 or higher and provision the SharePoint Success Site from the M365 learning pathways administration page.
<br>
If you are unsure, navigate to your tenant's **M365 Learning Pathways administration page**:

  ![Image learning pathways admin page](media/sss-lp-version.png)

If you are unsure, navigate to your tenant's **M365 Learning Pathways administration page** and then select **About web part:**

  ![Image learning pathways admin page](media/sss-lp-elipses.png)
<br>

#### If you need to, update M365 learning pathways from version 3.0 to version 4.0 or higher

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The person updating M365 learning pathways must be an Administrator of the tenant’s App Catalog. If the person provisioning M365 learning pathways isn't an Administrator of the App Catalog, [complete these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/addappadmin) and continue.

In this step, you upload the M365 learning pathways 4.0 web part to the SharePoint App Catalog, and then navigate to the M365 learning pathways Administration page to start the update process.

**Upload the web part package:**

1. Go to the [GitHub custom learning repository](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/customlearning/manualcustomlearninginstall), select customlearning.sppkg and then download it to a local drive on your PC.

3. Select Admin > Show All > SharePoint > More Features.
4. Under Apps, select Open.
5. Select App Catalog > Distribute Apps for SharePoint.
6. Select Upload > Choose Files.
