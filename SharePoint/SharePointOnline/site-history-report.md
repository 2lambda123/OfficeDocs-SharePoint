# View SharePoint site history in SharePoint admin center

Site history report lets you view SharePoint site actions made in the last 30 days. Create up to five reports that filter by dates, names, sites, actions, and users. Once the site history report is generated, you can download the report as a .csv file. The duplicate button allows you to create more reports with similar parameters.

> [!NOTE]
> You can export data for up to 180 days with a site history report. However, this is dependent on your Microsoft 365 subscription and additional add-ons that allow you to keep your data longer.

## View site history reports

There are two ways to view site history reports in the SharePoint admin center:

- To go directly to site history reports, expand Reports and select Site history.
- To access them from the recent actions panel, expand Sites and select Active sites. Select Your recent actions and select Go to the site history report at the bottom.

You can create new reports, delete, and refresh their statuses from the site history page. This page will only show five reports at a time. A best practice is to delete a previous report before creating a new one. If not, the new report will take the place of an older report.

## Create a site history report

1. To create a site history report, go to the Site history page and select Create new report.  

2. A panel appears on the right where you can specify the type of information you want to include in your site history report. Select Create report to generate a new report.

3. The new report is listed on the Site history page. Select the report to open the site history report panel and monitor its status.

4. Once the report is created, select Download report to export the data as a .csv file.

> [!NOTE]
The report will take hours to generate depending on the search criteria selected when creating the report.
