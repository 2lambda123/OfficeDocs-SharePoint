# Review recent SharePoint site actions

[!INCLUDE[Advanced Management](includes/advanced-management.md)]

With the recent actions panel, administrators can make changes to SharePoint site properties and review their most recent actions in the [SharePoint admin center](/sharepoint/get-started-new-admin-center).

Changes to site properties like site name, site deletion and storage quota, show as recent actions. The panel lists the previous and current values of site properties, which can be useful when tracking changes.

The recent actions panel only shows the changes you make to site properties. Changes made by other admins and organization-level changes won't show in the panel.

> [!NOTE]
> Recent actions panel is not available for global readers. GDAP administrators will not be able to see the previous and current values of the admin actions.

## Premium and non-premium features of recent actions panel

### Premium

With the [Microsoft Syntex - SharePoint Advanced Management subscription](advanced-management.md), you'll have access to premium features of recent actions panel. The premium version lets you:

- review actions made within the last 30 days
- export and download a.csv file detailing all the changes made within the last 30 days

### Non-premium

The non-premium version of recent actions panel lets you:

- review actions made within the current session
- export and download a .csv containing only the actions made within the current session

> [!WARNING]
> Once you close the browser or sign out, the recent actions panel will clear the history in the non-premium version.

## Requirements

To access and use the **premium** version of this feature, your organization must have the following subscription:

- [Microsoft Syntex - SharePoint Advanced Management](advanced-management.md)

## View recent actions of a site

1. In the SharePoint admin center, expand **Sites** and select **Active sites**.
2. Select **Your recent actions**. The recent actions panel appears on the right and lists your most recent 30 actions made within the last 30 days.
3. Select **Export** to download the list as a .csv file.
4. Select **View site details** to open the site info panel. From here, you can make changes to site properties like site name, site address, hub association, and aliases.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you close your browser while actions are in-progress, they will not show in the .csv file. Failed actions are viewable in the recent actions panel, but are omitted in the exported .csv file.

## Bulk site edits

Hereâ€™s an example of how bulk edits are grouped as one action in the recent actions panel:

You deleted 4 SharePoint sites on May 21 at 6:15 PM. The bulk edit will show as one item named Deleted 4 sites on the recent actions panel. Select the Deleted 4 sites action and the list of deleted SharePoint sites appears.
