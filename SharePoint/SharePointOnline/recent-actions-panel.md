# Review recent Sharepoint site actions in SharePoint admin center

With recent actions panel, you can make changes to SharePoint site properties and review your most recent 30 actions in [SharePoint admin center](/sharepoint/get-started-new-admin-center).

Changes to site properties like site name, site deletion and storage quota, show as recent actions. The panel shows the previous and current value of site properties, which is useful when tracking changes.

The recent actions list only shows actions you made from the SharePoint admin center in the last 30 days. The recent actions panel won’t show changes made by other admins in your organization or organization-level changes.

You can also download a .csv file of all your changes made in the last 30 days. The exported data from the .csv file is especially useful when you need to perform a deeper analysis.

## View recent actions of a site

1. In  the SharePoint admin center, expand **Sites** and select **Active sites**.
2. Select **Your recent actions**. The recent actions panel appears on the right and lists your most recent 30 actions made within the last 30 days.
3. You can select **Export** to download the list as a .csv file.
4. Select **View site details** to open the site info panel. From here, you can make changes to site properties like site name, site address, hub association, and aliases.

## Bulk site edits

Bulk edits such as deleting multiple sites are listed as one action item in the recent actions panel. Select a bulk action item to see a list of sites affected by a bulk edit.

Bulks edits are listed as separate items in the .csv file. The bulk edit column of the report lets you quickly filter which changes were part of a bulk edit.

Here’s an example of how bulk edits are grouped as one action in the recent actions panel:

You deleted 4 SharePoint sites on May 21 at 6:15 PM. The bulk edit will show as one item named Deleted 4 sites on the recent actions panel. Select the Deleted 4 sites action and the list of deleted SharePoint sites appears.
