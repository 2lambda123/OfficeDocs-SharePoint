# Hold a town hall in Yammer and ceep the conversation going

Bring your organization together to communicate the overall state of the business, status of large-scale projects, success stories, and growth opportunities. Create an end-to-end live event experience in Yammer that engages audiences before, during, and after the event.

Organizations often call their large-scale events for employees a town hall. Sometimes organizations refer to a town hall as an all-hands meeting or all-company meeting. In this example, we’ll be referring to this type of meeting as an organization town hall, but the steps and guidance can be used the same way for similar meetings and live events in Yammer.

Get started preparing and implementing a town hall that is on demand, secure, accessible to all audiences, and allows you to keep the conversation going after the live event.  



Town halls can help bring your organization together by:  

- Sharing information in a meaningful and engaging format
- Building trust and connections across an organization
- Broadcasting to large groups of people at one time 
- Expanding community and employee engagement through shared experiences
- Keeping the conversation going in channels related to the town hall
- Using live event analytics to understand event reach and engagement 
- Connecting employees and teams through hybrid work

## Plan a town hall

Since town halls reach broad and diverse audiences, you’ll want to consider the needs and preferences of your audience and make sure content can be accessed before, during, and after the event.

(insert infographic)

**Planning considerations:**
- The town hall is a virtual live event and can be accessed by different people across different regions and time zones.
- Many people will attend using a mobile device.
- Some people won’t attend the live event, but will want to watch the event recording later.
- Some people won’t watch the full recording, but will want to see highlights of the most important information therefore after the town hall, a recording and highlights can be shared in the form of a SharePoint news post.
- Event Q&A can take place in a Yammer community, so people who couldn’t attend can still benefit from the information shared.
- Promoting the town hall event will be most successful by diversifying the different channels that are currently being used by your audience.

### Learn about your audience

Invest in learning what’s most important to your audience. Knowing your audience will help you determine how to effectively deliver your message, what speakers will resonate with your audience, how to moderate the town hall , and how to  structure the town hall.

### Ensure content is accessible to everyone

Town halls are designed to reach the entire organization or large groups within it. Make sure  the event’s  target audience  has access to the tools they need to consume the content.

- Plan to record town hall events. When a live event is recorded, it will automatically be added to Microsoft Stream. Learn how to enable autogenerate captions. The live event can also be saved to the Yammer home page. 
- If your organization operates across multiple geographic regions, make sure the time zone the event takes place in allows for the majority of people to attend live.  
- Yammer supports live events and town halls in many languages across multiple platforms.
- Ensure attendees have mobile access to the town hall via the Yammer app or Viva Connections (link). 



### Define the town hall message

Craft a message that’s well organized, detailed, and to the point. To engage your audience and make sure the messages in the town hall are understood by everyone:
 
- Make the presentation visual. Use PowerPoint to create a visual display of your message to keep your audience connected. Organizations have the option of broadcasting a live event in Yammer using Teams. Learn to configure desktop sharing in Microsoft Teams to display your PowerPoint deck during your townhall. (fact check)
- Provide town hall objectives to attendees beforehand. Share these objectives via email or the event SharePoint site.
- Only share the most relevant information. Ensure the most important information is highlighted to reserve time and to keep your audience engaged. 


### Decide the live event speakers and structure  

Invite speakers who align with the message of the town hall. If the intent of your event is to report on  quarterly earnings,  recruit people from the finance department who can speak to insights and answer questions.  

- Develop the schedule and time limits for the town hall.
- Assign roles to moderators and brief them on key tasks If you plan to use live Q&A during the event, prepare speakers with a list of known concerns or questions . 
- Test equipment beforehand. Make sure each speaker and moderator knows  how to use the tools used to  conduct the town hall. This can range from how to share their screen,  access the Q&A box,locate incoming comments, and more.

Inform and prepare your audience for your event by creating a SharePoint communications site  using the Events template. Include instructions for attending as well as any other necessary top-of-mind items.

**Promote in Outlook**

Invite all attendees to the event with a calendar invite via email in Outlook. Provide detailed information such as a link to the SharePoint event site, the Yammer meeting link, and the Yammer event page. 

Include objectives or talking points in the invite as well. This will help attendees prepare questions to ask during the event.
