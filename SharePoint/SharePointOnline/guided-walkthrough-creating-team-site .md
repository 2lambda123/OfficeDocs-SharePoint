# Guided walkthrough: Creating a Team site

In this article, we show you elements of an example Team site to inspire you, and help you learn how to create similar sites for your own organization.

Use a team site when you want to collaborate with other members of your team or with others on a specific project. With a team site, typically all or most members can contribute content to the site and the information is limited to only the members of the team or project and specific stakeholders. Additionally, team sites are connected to [groups](https://support.microsoft.com/office/learn-about-microsoft-365-groups-b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2) and a [Teams channel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/video-what-is-microsoft-teams-422bf3aa-9ae8-46f1-83a2-e65720e1a34d). This makes it easy for your team to have group permissions, as well as a Teams space to chat, meet, and share files.

First, if you haven't already created a Team site, check out [Create a team site in SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-a-team-site-in-sharepoint-ef10c1e7-15f3-42a3-98aa-b5972711777d).

If you need to learn how to edit and publish the page on your site, check out the section [Manage sections and web parts] <!-- daisy bookmark--> in this article.

Once you have created your site and know how to edit pages, you can use the guidance below to add the elements shown.
