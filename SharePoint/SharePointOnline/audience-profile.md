# Step 3: Scope audience size and determine audience preferences

Consider who needs the information you will be communicating. This could be as a specific part of your organization, remote workers, marketing professionals or engineers, and so on. Scope the size of your audience and determine the right channels for your communication. Learn about the consumption needs and preferences of your audience. For example, some audiences may have the bandwidth and be able to engage with video content, while others may prefer reading content at their own pace.

Understand where and how your target audience typically communicates. For example, if your audience is frontline workers and primarily get news from the SharePoint mobile app or using Viva Connections in the Microsoft Teams mobile app, you may decide to only post news in SharePoint and then promote news in Yammer and Teams. Or perhaps you have a remote workforce where online meetings are advantageous. Finally, learn about how to create Microsoft 365 groups and use audience targeting to make sure the right content gets to the right people.

## Start by scoping audience size
Understanding the size of your audience will help you narrow down what Microsoft 365 applications will help you reach your goals. Once you’ve determined your audiences, you can use one - or a combination of methods - to share news, announcements, and more.

## Audience size considerations
Learn more about considerations as you scope your audience size. Small audiences are straight forward and relatively low risk when it comes to data protection and content durability. As your audience size grows, so do the risks and considerations like accessibility, multilingual options, and data security.

#### Accessibility
Accessibility is important for all organizations, and especially corporate communications. Ensuring content is accessible benefits everyone. Accessibility includes making sure content in SharePoint can be easily consumed, limiting background noise in Teams meetings, turning on-screen captions for live events, and more. Learn more about accessibility, and apply learnings to meet the needs of your audience(s):

#### Multilingual options
Part of ensuring content is accessible is knowing when content should be available in more than one language. This is especially important for communications that cross more than one region and country. 
<br>

- Learn more about how to [create SharePoint communication sites, pages, and news posts in more than one language](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-multilingual-communication-sites-pages-and-news-2bb7d610-5453-41c6-a0e8-6f40b3ed750c)

- [Use the Translator app to translate conversations](https://translator.microsoft.com) in Microsoft Teams chat and meetings

#### Data protection and compliance
Sharing confidential information and documents with large audiences always imposes data risks. Microsoft has many tools that help protect data, prevent data loss, and ensure the right people have the right access to information. Review how to classify SharePoint sites and documents, guest sharing, and how to set up teams and channels in Microsoft for conversations that will include sensitive or confidential data.

## Audience work environment considerations and device preferences
Audience size will help you narrow down potential communication solution(s) in combination with considerations for how, when, and where your audience gets work done. Corporate communications should aim to meet workers where they are and make it easy to engage and participate.
<br>
<image>


#### Frontline workers
Frontline workers are team members who do not sit at a desk for most of their work. This audience includes healthcare workers, retail personal, sales teams, and support teams. 
- This audience is likely using their mobile device most of the time to get work done
- Communications need to be concise, easy to access, and visually engaging
- It is unlikely that this audience will be able to attend an event all at once, therefore you should plan to record and share the event in a news post or email
- Consider using Viva Connections to create an engaging communication experience that helps organizations stay connected
<br>

#### Remote audiences
Remote audiences do not work in a centralized office location and may even work from their home. This audience includes gig workers, agencies, consultants, and jobs that take place at a desk or computer.

- This audience uses a combination of devices but primary uses a desktop device
- Remote audiences are good candidates for live events, moderated Q&A, and live chats in Yammer or Microsoft Teams since most people can participate together
- Remote audiences are more likely to suffer from meeting fatigue and looking at a screen most of the day, so diversified communications that do not require a camera or desktop screen is ideal
<br>

#### Hybrid audiences
Hybrid audiences are a blend of audiences. Common blends are remote workers and in-office workers and in-office workers and frontline workers. Some organizations may have frontline workers, in-office workers, and remote workers. In some scenarios, you may be trying to reach a similar audience, but they work in different time zones or locations, which also make them a hybrid audience.

- Hybrid communication needs to be especially inclusive to accommodate other working schedules, access to internet, languages, and time zones
- Consider using more than one channel or communication method to reach team members with different working styles
- Create feedback channels that allow people to participate in conversations, share their perspective, and network with others

## Learn how to target content and events to specific audiences
Regardless of the app you choose to drive your communications, there are more Microsoft 365 services that can be used to ensure the right content gets to the right audience.

### Use Microsoft 365 groups
Planning and organizing Microsoft 365 groups into different audiences based on role, region, department, and division will be helpful when producing and launching corporate communications. Most applications rely on Microsoft 365 groups to target content, for example email in Outlook, virtual meetings in Teams, permissions to SharePoint sites, and more.

## SharePoint audience targeting 
For communication that takes place in SharePoint, you’ll have access to a feature called [audience targeting](https://support.microsoft.com/office/target-content-to-a-specific-audience-on-a-sharepoint-site-68113d1b-be99-4d4c-a61c-73b087f48a81). Audience targeting helps the most relevant content get to the right audiences. By enabling audience targeting, specific content will be prioritized to specific audiences using M365 groups through SharePoint web parts, page libraries, and navigational links.
