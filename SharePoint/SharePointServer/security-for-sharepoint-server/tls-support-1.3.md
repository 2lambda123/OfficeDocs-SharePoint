# TLS Support 1.3

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md.md)]

**Supported and not supported components in TLS 1.3**
  
By default, `.NET Framework 4.8` on Windows Server 2022 supports TLS 1.3. 

The following networking and security components in SharePoint Server Subscription Edition still do not support TLS 1.3:
- `Windows Server vers earlier than Windows Server 2022`
- `SQL Server 2019`ions
- `Workflow Manager 1.0 and Service Bus 1.1`
