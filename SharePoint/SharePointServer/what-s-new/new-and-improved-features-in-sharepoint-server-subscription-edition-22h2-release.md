### Copy and Move improvement in modern document library

The modern document library supports copying and moving files across document libraries. Previously, the **copy** and **move** operations were only scoped within same document library in the modern document library UX. In the new experience, when a user picks a file or multiple files and triggers a **copy** or **move** operation, the user will have the option to pick a destination outside the current document library. 
- **Copy** will allow users to pick a destination location in different subsites, in different site collections, and in different web applications. 
- **Move** will allow users to pick a destination location in different document libraries in the same site.
Rather than just copying or moving the file, the metadata of the file will be preserved as long as the same term store is used in both the source and destination locations.
