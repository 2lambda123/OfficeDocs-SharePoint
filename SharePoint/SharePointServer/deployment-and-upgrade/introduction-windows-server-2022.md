# Introducing Windows Server 2022

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md.md)]

Windows Server 2022 will be a [Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started-19/servicing-channels-19) version of Windows Server and the next major version after Windows Server 2019.

To get Windows Server build, you must first register for the Windows [Insider Program for Windows Server](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/for-business-getting-started-server). Once you have registered, visit the [Windows Server Insider Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewserver) page to download the builds. Ensure to download the "Windows Server LTSC Preview" build, not the "Windows Server Semi-Annual Preview" build. You can monitor the [Windows Server Insiders Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-server-insiders/bd-p/WindowsServerInsiders) for the latest announcements of new Windows Server builds and features, including the trial product keys for each build.

## Whatâ€™s new in Windows Server 2022

Following are some of the new features and improvements in virtualization, networking, security, and more, that are available with Windows Server 2022:

- Performance improvements in the Hyper-V virtual switch to reduce CPU load.
- Performance improvements in both TCP and UDP networking to maximize bandwidth, minimize packet loss, and reduce CPU load.
- Support for TLS 1.3, the latest and strongest connection encryption standard.
- Support for AES-256-GCM encryption in SMB file sharing, along with compressed file transfers over the network when using the `robocopy.exe` and `xcopy.exe` tools with the/compress parameter.
