# System requirements for SharePoint Server Subscription Edition

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-xxx-xxx-xxx-SUB-xxx-md.md)]
  
Before you install SharePoint Server Subscription Edition, you must make sure that you have installed all required hardware and software. To effectively plan your deployment, you must understand the level of support that is provided for the web browsers that you will be using in your environment and how support for IP versions 4 and 6 is implemented in SharePoint Servers. You must also understand the URL and path length restrictions in SharePoint Servers.

The following articles help you prepare for the installation of SharePoint Server by providing information about the prerequisites that you must have in order to run SharePoint Server.
